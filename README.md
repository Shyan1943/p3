# Milestone Project 3 (Python and Data Centric Development)

```
Project Idea : 
● Create an online vessel schedule platform 

Project Purpose : 
● In this project, I build a full-stack site that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.
 
Main Technologies : 
● Required: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB Additional libraries and external APIs
 
Value provided:
● Users make use of the site to share their own data with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members.
The site owner advances their own goals by providing this functionality, potentially by being a regular user themselves. The site owner might also benefit from the collection of the dataset as a whole.

```

## UI/UX
### 1) STRATEGY
```
External user’s goal:
● Find and share vessel schedule 
 
Site owner's goal:
● Promote a brand of one-stop logistics services

## Features
```
Potential features to include:
● Create a web application that allows users to store and easily access vessel sailing schedule. The schedule would include fields such as vessel details, date, searchable, download function, booking tools etc.
● Create the back-end code and front-end form(s) to allow users to create schedule to the site, read, update and delete them. 
● Create the back-end and front-end functionality for users to locate schedule based on the sailing schedule fields by using a full search functionality, <—or just a directory of schedule.—> 
● Provide results in a manner that is visually appealing and user friendly.
 
Advanced potential feature <—(nice-to-have)
● Build upon the schedule (port to port) or after booking prompt out to promote site owner’s one-stop services (e.g. Container trucking, packing, stuffing, air/sea/land international shipping & etc).
● Create a dashboard to provide some statistics about all the Singapore exporting/shipping news.
