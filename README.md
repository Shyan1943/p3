# Milestone Project 3 (Python and Data Centric Development)

```
Project Purpose : 
● In this project, I build a full-stack site that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.
 
Main Technologies : 
● Required: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB Additional libraries and external APIs
 
Value provided:
● Users make use of the site to share their own data with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members.
● The site owner advances their own goals by providing this functionality, potentially by being a regular user themselves. The site owner might also benefit from the collection of the dataset as a whole.
```
```
Project Idea 1
● Create an online vessel schedule platform 
 
External user’s goal:
● Find and share vessel schedule 
 
Site owner's goal:
● Promote a brand of one-stop logistics services
```

## UI/UX
### 1) STRATEGY
#### 1a) Defining the Project
This is an online vessel schedule platform, which users can share their schedules with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members,  The site owner advances their own goals by providing this functionality, potentially by being a regular user themselves. The site owner might also benefit from the collection of the dataset as a whole.

#### 1b) Target audience
#### 1c) Identifying External Users
#### Identifying External Users' Objective:
#### 1d) Identifying Site Owners' Objective:
#### Therefore, the platform should focus on:



### 2) SCOPE
#### 2a) User stories
#### 2b) Functional Requirement
#### 2c) Content Requirement

|:-------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  | Create a web application that allows users to store and easily access vessel sailing schedule. The schedule would include fields such as vessel details, date, searchable, download function, booking tools etc.|
|  | Create the back-end code and front-end form(s) to allow users to create schedule to the site, read, update and delete them.|
|  | Create the back-end and front-end functionality for users to locate schedule based on the sailing schedule fields by using a full search functionality |
|  | Provide results in a manner that is visually appealing and user f|riendly. |
 
| Status  | Advanced feature                                                            |
|:-------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  | Build upon the schedule (port to port) or after booking prompt out to promote site owner’s one-stop services (e.g. Container trucking, packing, stuffing, air/sea/land international shipping & etc).|
|  | Create a dashboard to provide some statistics about all the Singapore exporting/shipping news. |


## Technologies Used 
```
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB Additional libraries and external APIs
```

## Deployment

### LO1 Design, develop and implement a back-end for a full-stack web application using Python and a micro-framework
```
1.1 a front end for a data-driven web application that meets accessibility guidelines, meets its given purpose and provides a set of user interactions 
1.2 Customs HTML and CSS code to create a responsive full-stack application 
1.3 Build a non-relational database-backed Flask web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.
```
